# shulker-shell-feature

This server-side Fabric mod adds a much needed gameplay feature to make the game more fun; giving you the ability to farm shulker shells.

### FEATURES

This is done by making Endermites behave similarly to Silver Fish, and having them invest Purpur Blocks (only the default Purpur Block, not any of it's smooth of chiseled variants). When an Endermite invests a Purpur Block, it tunes into a Shulker, which can then be killed for the Shulker Shell drops as normal. To make farming easier, the mod also gives Dispensers the ability to dispense Ender Pearls, which does not teleport the player, but simply has the same chance of spawning an Endermite as if thrown by the player.
